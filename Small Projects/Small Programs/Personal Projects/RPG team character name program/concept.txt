I've always wanted to make a turn-based game.

With the limited knowledge I have I made a simple text-based program
that allows a user to name 5 party members.

The names are stored in a list and at the end the user can choose
to change the names one at a time, or end the program.

This took me over an hour to figure out, but I had a lot of fun making it.
I had a little trouble getting the indexing right because what the user
sees as position #1 is actually position #0, but I figured it out and
felt accomplished.
